Calvin and Hobbes search. [Demo](https://darrenjennings.github.io/spaceman-spiffy/) <br>
See [intro post](https://darrenjennings.github.io/spaceman-spiffy-blog/) on building this fun little side project. The days are just packed, eh?

### Prerequisites
- Node >= v8.4 / npm
- yarn


### Installing

```bash
yarn install
```

## Running the tests

```bash
yarn test
```

## Deployment
This is a 100% static site (html + js + css). Build it using webpack!
```bash
yarn build
```

## Contributing

I made this for fun. I wouldn't recommend submitting PR's, just gazing longingly at C&H comics.
